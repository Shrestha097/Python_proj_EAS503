       "  \"History &amp; Background The Bank started its activities in Feb. 1985 at the time when the economic arena was characterized by major developments, a matter which gave the bank mission special significance, as Egypt was suffering at that time from great pressures on its balance of payments. This was apart from the rising deficit of the balance of trade. Consequently, the external debt problem started to represent a sort of concern to the Egyptian economy in all its sectors.The Bank was founded as a financial institution to boost Egyptian exports. The export development issue is not only an economic policy to cope with the balance of payments problem, but also represents a strategic trend for development policies in a global economy that gets closer and integrated every day. Accordingly, the export sector is a crucial propeller for modernization and development. There are various examples of many small and medium size countries in which the export sector played a significant role in developing their economies.General Trend of Bank Activities Export Development Bank of Egypt adopts special measures such as excellence and quality in playing its pivotal role. Through its distinguished performance, the bank aims to be one of the remarkable financial centers, thus it does not confine its target to attain maximum profitability only, but also to achieve prosperity.Since its inception, the Bank has managed to maintain its identity as a commercial and investment bank; rather than a deposit collecting retail commercial bank. The bank has always been eager to support the export sector through financing investment projects pertaining to such sector, which is contrary to the main philosophy of commercial banks that aim at working capital financing for existing projects. In Egypt common practice has shown that most of the development banks have turned to current operations and deposit gathering, acting as mere commercial banks and thus deviating from their authentic target of being investment and development financial institutions.The bank resorted to opening of new branches and gathering deposits in order to meet its main goal of establishing and boosting a solid export sector. Consequently, the bank persisted on gathering deposits of companies and corporations in order to be a wholesale bank. The bank re-affirmed its geographic presence in export oriented locations like that of Alexandria that was opened in May 1989 and Tenth of Ramadan in September 1989.With the change of the government monetary policy during the early nineties, and the tendency to develop sources of finance through issuing treasury bills and bonds, and lifting subsidized interest rates by all means,\\xa0 the bank was motivated to establish a network of branches to mobilize financial resources. Accordingly, the network of branches at our bank had increasingly expanded to 21 branches in March 2012.With the beginning of the financial reform in 2004 following the amendment of Central Bank Law, as well as The Banking Sector and Money Law no. 88/2003, Central Bank reclassified all banks thus giving them full freedom to open new branches and promote several saving. Accordingly, the bank had to rectify all its future plans to include branch expansion policy, as well as the new banking products that concern individuals and corporations.\\xa0\\xa0Developments of Bank's Activities :Throughout the life of the Bank that exceeds quarter of a century, EDBE witnessed numerous aspect of development, most significant of which were the following:Ownership :Ownership:Regarding ownership structure, the Bank has endeavored to develop the Egyptian capital market through launching new products in order to assume its basic role as an important source of funding. At first, the bank managed to change its articles of association to allow the private sector and the Egyptian family sector to contribute to its capital. It also aspired to allow its staff to own some shares of its capital part as one kind of propagating the culture of dealing with the capital market and as an incentive to the staff to further foster their loyalty and belonging to the institution in which they work.On the other hand, the Bank managed to establish companies focusing on export development, thus allowing the staff own some shares of their capital. Such companies realized good gains for the bank when sold e.g. Roto Pack and Techno Pack.Loans &amp; advancesIt is worth mentioning that the Bank's loans and advances portfolio has experienced several phases of progress throughout the history of the Bank. At the beginning, the bank focused on medium term finance for export projects or those that aim at exports in order to increase the export capacity of the country thus propagating the culture of production for export and not export of surplus products.In a subsequent phase, the bank expanded to focus on financing the working capital of different sectors of the economy.The global financial crisis at the end of the twentieth century that hit the banking sector in Egypt left behind it several criticized and troubled debts that had, in turn, its effects on our Bank. Subsequently, our Bank encountered some difficulties as a result of having a high segment of exporters who deal with the external world, thus encountering some problems which, in turn, had its effects on the credit portfolio. Nevertheless, through its efforts and due to its high coverage ratio and credit worthiness, the bank became one of the most reputable high ranking institutions regarding the quality of its loan portfolio.\\xa0\",\n",

YOU WILL EARN 10% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR TEAMS CLIENT BASE! PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE! If you are working in the merchant cash advance/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully. Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation. Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make. What a disaster that would be. Wouldn\\'t you agree? But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal. We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry. We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country. The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify. Your manager\\'s agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals. Gross profit for our Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions. Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company. An Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders. Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place). If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit. On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60/40. So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager. Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month. Even on the subprime\\xa0deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal. So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%, Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees. On a 50K subprime\\xa0deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager.\\xa0Your manager’s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps. Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left. This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days. We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid,\\xa0 We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail. We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way. We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A. Recruit Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B. Train Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C. Manage Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company) If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business. If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins. This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person. If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad. If you are a rep sitting in someone else\\'s business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply. We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area. But you may recruit offline wherever you want. So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back. Again, \"NO EXPERIENCE IN THE MCA INDUSTRY\", \"NO POSITION\". . .\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

Only after this has been considered will we consider the impact of our decisions on FBN, followed by our fellow team members, and finally ourselves. Before making a decision, we listen to farmers and learn about how implementing it will impact them.While making a decision or working on a project, we prefer working in small teams to make sure our employees feel empowered and own their decisions. Finally, after our decisions are made, we communicate those decisions to our farmers and to the rest of the team.FBN employees are a diverse group with a common passion for agriculture. We respect humility, value honesty, and despise entitlement. We see farmers as hackers and entrepreneurs, able to fix things with duct tape and baling wire while predicting the weather and analysing their financial position on the commodities market. Just like farmers, we believe that if something is broken, it’s better to fix it than to complain about it.All FBN employees, regardless of the position, will spend meaningful time visiting farms, to meet with some of our founding and network farmers in order to discuss their equipment and data collection practices.As a Silicon Valley based company with a Midwestern culture, we believe in the power of getting things done, and understand that creativity is fostered by trust and the ability to focus. As a result, meetings are avoided and we respect everyone’s right to at least one day a week without meetings. Thursdays are considered “no meeting days.”Finally, there are no shrinking violets here. The team consists of many people with deep experience in agriculture, technology, data science, machine learning, physics among other areas. So be prepared to offer opinions!Interviewing at FBNOur interview panels are as diverse as our employees. You may be expected to interview with an agronomist, a physicist, a data scientist, and because of our strong focus on farmers, we expect every FBN candidate to interview with one of our founding farmers, advisory board members or network members. As a result, our interviews will take you out of your comfort zone. Be prepared to be asked to solve hard problems that may seem daunting, to be asked questions that will test your curiosity, and to meet really awesome people.If FBN sounds like a place where you would like to work and if you're excited about making a difference in the lives of thousands of farmers, take a look at our current openings.\",\n",

The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers.

Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched,\\xa0our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions.\\xa0In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members,\\xa0once they do the first project they want more and more.\\xa0As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door.\"\\xa0\"Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here. \\xa0Here, the\\xa0PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product,\\xa0including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from,\\xa0this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope.\\xa0The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.\"\\xa0This is what not shared on the JD.\\xa0\"How you will mature your career.\"\\xa0Job Responsibilities:\\xa0• For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

This past year, that founding class graduated from Sci. When they entered, they performed on average at a 4.5 grade level in both reading and math. Upon graduation, 94% of them were accepted into a 4-year college or university.

While drivers use the application to declare their position and availability, passengers use the Taxibeat app to virtually \"see\" all nearby available taxi drivers, in a range of about 2 kms. They see every possible information about each driver (distance, car model, customers\\' rating, services provided, etc) and select which driver to hail with a touch on the screen.

PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE! If you are working in the merchant cash advance/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully. Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation. Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make. What a disaster that would be. Wouldn\\'t you agree? But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal. We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry. We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country. The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify. Your manager\\'s agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals. Gross profit for our Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions. Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company. An Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders. Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place). If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit. On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60/40. So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager. Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month. Even on the subprime\\xa0deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal. So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%, Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees. On a 50K subprime\\xa0deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager.\\xa0Your manager’s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps. Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left. This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days. We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid,\\xa0 We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail. We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way. We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A. Recruit Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B. Train Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C. Manage Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company) If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business. If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins. This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person. If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad. If you are a rep sitting in someone else\\'s business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply. We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area. But you may recruit offline wherever you want. So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back. Again, \"NO EXPERIENCE IN THE MCA INDUSTRY\", \"NO POSITION\". . .\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

In 1943 branch offices were opened in San Francisco followed by Seattle in 1956.The company’s market position and business began to grow during the late 1950′s and 1960′s after adding Wilsonart’s high-pressure laminate line to its product mix.During the 1970′s under the leadership of E.B.

This is the purest form of market economy, because we enable companies to pitch their ideas, prove their business concepts, and inspire confidence in the investors on an open platform with identified investors base. Our openness and coherence allow business to raise necessary funds and attract crowds to find their products and services.Who are we for?Small and medium sized companies with innovative and eye-catching ideas with a trustworthy management dedicated to execute them.Forward-looking investors who seek to invest in growth businesses with creditworthy business plans. He or She also benefit not only from the financial returns, but also from the satisfaction of being involved in exciting business ideas.Why do we do it?Financial sector is not focused on serving the interests of small businesses. Big banking monopolies and behind-the-door deals have made finance exclusive for limited amount of people. This, however, is inefficient for business.On one side, there are plentiful investors with idle cash on their balance, because traditional finance has failed them. On the other side, there is a myriad of companies who cannot get a business loan form a bank, because they lack sufficient collateral.
